# ClipVault - Claude Notes

> Read `AGENTS.md` first. This file is intentionally short to avoid drift.

## Read Order

1. **AGENTS.md** - Source of truth for workflow, build rules, and conventions
2. **PROGRESS.md** - Current status and active tasks
3. **AGENT_WORKFLOW.md** - Step-by-step development process
4. **PLAN.md** - Roadmap and task details
5. **docs/** - Deep technical references when needed

## Claude-Specific Reminders

- Follow `AGENTS.md` if anything conflicts.
- Use `@coderabbitai` commands in PR comments when reviewing feedback.
- Do not commit or push without explicit user permission.
